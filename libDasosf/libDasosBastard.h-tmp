/* This program reads in a file to a dump struct.
 * It assumes that the reader has the same sizes 
 * for all struct elements as the writer.
 * As of now this is:
 *   int: 4; char: 1; u_ints: 4; timeval: 8
 * Note that OSX timeval is 16
 * Ideally the writer should be changed to use untyped 
 * vars with set lengths when writing, then the reader
 * can use an untyped reader which is converted into a
 * typed version to guarantee compatibility regardless 
 * of writer OS version changes.
