Running s2eget

First, boot the VM in the S2E version of QEMU in non-S2E mode. Copy s2eget into the guest over SSH (or any other method). Then run the tool, for example, as follows:

guest$ ./s2eget <filename> && chmod +x ./<filename> && ./<filename>

where <filename> specifies what file to download from the host and execute in the guest.

When being run like that in non-S2E mode, s2eget simply waits. At that point, save the VM snapshot and then load it in S2E mode. s2eget will detect it and download the file. The rest of the command line will make it executable and execute it.

Note that you could resume this snapshot as many times as you want, changing the program and/or trying different S2E options.
